In this paper our aim is to acquire in depth knowledge of Software Defined Network (SDN). 
Learn the SDN security attacks performed on SDN at different layers. 
Explore the existing prevention techniques designed, researched and implemented. 
We are interested in exploring one particular type of attack i.e. DDOS that can launched at different levels. 
We also intend to provide a solution to resolve or mitigate this attack as early as possible.
