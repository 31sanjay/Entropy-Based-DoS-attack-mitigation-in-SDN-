Title- Entropy Based mitigation of Distributed Denial-of-Service attack in Software Defined Network (SDN)

Introduction
SDN is three layer architecture- Application layer, Control layer, and Data layer.
It provides the centralized control intelligence and programmable network by decoupling the network control and data plane.
It provides a dynamic, cost-effective, manageable and agile platform for configuration of the network.
The centralized platform brings the new security challenges such as DDoS attack.
The proposed research will be to prevent DDoS attack on control plane based on Entropy

SDN Architecure


Problem Statement
Prevention of DoS attack on control plane of SDN.
The Implementation of mechanism to establish trust between controller, switches, and hosts.

Issues in the problem
Prompt to DoS attack because of limited switch buffer size.
Integrity check not available for the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) used by the SDN controller for discovery of the network topology.
No mechanism for authentication of request packet reaching to controller of SDN.
